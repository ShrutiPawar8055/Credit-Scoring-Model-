This is a Machine Learning project I worked on during my internship with CodeAlpha. The aim was to build a credit scoring model that can help predict whether a loan should be approved or not. I used features like income, loan amount, term, and credit history to train models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest. I also did data cleaning, visualization, and model evaluation using Python libraries like pandas, seaborn, and scikit-learn. This project helped me understand how ML can be used for real-world decision-making in finance.
